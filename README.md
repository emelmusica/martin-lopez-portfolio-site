Week 2 Challenge Portfolio site

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


# On this assignment I watched a youtube video that took me step by step on building a basic website with a navigation bar along with it's css styling. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgAZ8KzfhO8

# I used w3schools.com for looking up the majority of my code along with some google searches and coding books that I purchased to help me study and use as a resource. 

# I also had a friend that is currently working as a web developer give me pointers and had me implement comments in my html and css so that it can help build my sites better. We were taught this during our pre-work and I'm trying to get more used to utilising it.
